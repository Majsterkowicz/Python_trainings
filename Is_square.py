# A square of squares
# You like building blocks. You especially like building
# blocks that are squares.
# And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square
# of square building blocks!

# However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you
# end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just
# had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait!
# That's it! You just have to check if your number of building
# blocks is a perfect square.

# Task
# Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

# In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer
# that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the
# product of some integer with itself.

# The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry
# about that in dynamic typed languages.
